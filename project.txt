Pet Simulator – OOP Project

Project Goal:

Create a pet simulator where you will work with different types of animals (dog, cat, parrot…),
each with its own attributes (hunger, energy, happiness), methods (feed, play, sleep),
random events (illness, fatigue), and you'll handle errors using exceptions.


Lesson 1 – Introduction to OOP, First Class: Pet
Create a basic class called Pet with the following attributes:
name (string),
hunger (number, range 0–100),
energy (number, range 0–100).
Write the __init__ constructor method.
Create at least one instance and print its attributes.

UPDATE-01:
add happiness to attributes

Instance Methods, Changing Pet State
Add the following methods to your Pet class:
feed() – decreases hunger
play() – decreases energy and increases happiness
sleep() – increases energy

Modify the methods so that they update the instance's attributes accordingly.
Test calling these methods on an instance of the class.

UPDATE-02:
Add an attribute named abilities or instincts, which should be a list type, as an animal can have multiple instincts.

Add a __str__() method for a nicely formatted display of the pet's information.
Set default values for the attributes in the __init__ method if they are not provided.

Create an example where hunger and energy are not given, and the default values are used.
